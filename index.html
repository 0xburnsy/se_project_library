              At this event, which celebrates the library's namesake, our guest
              lecturer will take us on a journey exploring some of the most
              prominent female researchers in the world of space science. It's
              easy to buy into the misconception that this field was mostly
              dominated by men, but our lecture aims to change that notion and
              prove that this hasn't been the case since at least the 18th
              century.

                  As a fan of Ernest Cline's Ready Player One, I can't help but
                  be swept up in the thrilling adventure that he has crafted.
                  The novel takes place in a near-future dystopia where the
                  world has become so bleak that people escape to the virtual
                  reality world of the OASIS. The story follows the quest of
                  Wade Watts, a teenage orphan who becomes embroiled in a
                  high-stakes treasure hunt for the creator's hidden Easter egg
                  within the OASIS. Cline's writing is filled with pop culture
                  references from the 1980s, which adds an extra layer of
                  nostalgia and fun for readers who grew up in that era. The
                  action is non-stop, and the stakes are high, as Wade and his
                  friends race against time to find the Easter egg before a
                  greedy corporation can get their hands on it. The themes of
                  the novel, including the power of teamwork and the dangers of
                  corporate greed, are woven seamlessly into the story. And the
                  character of Wade, with his love of classic video games and
                  his determination to overcome his disadvantaged background, is
                  a hero that readers can truly root for. Overall, Ready Player
                  One is a thrilling ride that captures the spirit of adventure
                  and nostalgia in a way that is sure to appeal to readers of
                  all ages.

                <p class="card__text">
                  As a die-hard fan of Stephen King's It, I can't help but
                  marvel at how King created such a chilling and unforgettable
                  tale. The story of the Losers Club, a group of outcast kids
                  who band together to battle an evil, shape-shifting entity
                  that preys on their fears, is both terrifying and deeply
                  moving. King's mastery of horror is on full display in this
                  novel, as he weaves together suspense, gore, and psychological
                  terror to create a sense of unease that lingers long after the
                  final page. But It is more than just a horror novel - it's
                  also a powerful coming-of-age story that explores themes like
                  friendship, trauma, and the struggle to confront the past. The
                  characters, from the brave and resourceful Beverly to the
                  stuttering but determined Bill, are so well-drawn and
                  sympathetic that it's impossible not to root for them as they
                  face off against the unspeakable horror of It. And of course,
                  the villain of the piece - the malevolent clown Pennywise -
                  has become an iconic figure of horror, haunting the nightmares
                  of readers and inspiring countless adaptations. For me, It is
                  a true masterpiece of horror fiction, and a testament to
                  Stephen King's status as one of the greatest writers of our
                  time.

                <p class="card__text">
                  As a devoted fan of the Harry Potter book series, I can
                  confidently say that J.K. Rowling created a truly magical
                  world that has captured the hearts and imaginations of
                  millions of readers around the world. The characters, from
                  Harry and his friends Hermione and Ron, to the mischievous
                  Weasley twins and the wise Dumbledore, are all so
                  well-developed and relatable that it's impossible not to
                  become emotionally invested in their stories. And of course,
                  the world of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is
                  absolutely enchanting, filled with quirky creatures,
                  mysterious potions, and thrilling magical battles. But what
                  really sets the Harry Potter books apart is the way they
                  tackle complex themes like friendship, love, and the fight
                  against injustice in a way that speaks to readers of all ages.
                  It's no wonder that the series has become a cultural
                  phenomenon, inspiring everything from theme parks to
                  fanfiction. For me, the Harry Potter books will always hold a
                  special place in my heart, and I know I'll continue to return
                  to them again and again for years to come.

                <h3 class="card__title">Dune</h3>
                <p class="card__text">
                  As a fan of Frank Herbert's Dune, I am constantly in awe of
                  the rich, complex world that he has created. The novel takes
                  place in a distant future where noble houses compete for
                  control of the desert planet Arrakis, the only source of the
                  valuable spice melange, which grants heightened consciousness
                  and longevity. The characters, from the young and charismatic
                  Paul Atreides to the cunning and manipulative Baron Harkonnen,
                  are so well-drawn and multi-dimensional that they feel like
                  real people. Herbert's writing is dense and philosophical,
                  exploring complex themes such as politics, ecology, and the
                  nature of power, while also delivering epic battles and
                  stunning plot twists. But what truly sets Dune apart is the
                  depth of its world-building - the intricacies of the planet
                  Arrakis, its ecology and culture, are so vividly described
                  that they feel like they could exist in reality. And the
                  concept of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, with their mystical
                  powers and long-term breeding program, adds a fascinating
                  layer of intrigue to the story. Overall, Dune is a towering
                  achievement of science fiction, a masterpiece that has
                  inspired generations of writers and readers alike, and a
                  timeless classic that continues to captivate new audiences
                  today.

              Libraries are essential establishments in practically every city,
              and Practicum's library is no exception. It first opened its doors
              way back in 2018, right as our humble town began bidding welcome
              to its very first citizens!
            </p>
            <p class="about__paragraph">
              Since its initial opening, the library has seen nearly 342
              visitors each month. That's almost 50% of our population! So far,
              most citizens have enjoyed reading books and making use of our
              ample online resources.
            </p>
            <p class="about__paragraph">
              The library gets its name from Joan Feynman, an American

              the American Geophysical Union.
